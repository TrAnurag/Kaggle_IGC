    ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions (Kaggle Competition)

Project Summary:
Background
There is a significant effect of age on health. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small. 
Problem Statement
To develop a predictive model capable of detecting the presence of three specific medical conditions based on measurements of health characteristics. The model will aid researchers in identifying potential patients who may have one or more of the specified medical conditions without requiring a long and intrusive process of data collection from patients. Currently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions, yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases.

Object:
•	Predictive Model Development: Build and train a predictive model capable of accurately classifying individuals into two classes: those with age-related medical conditions (Class 1) and those without any age-related conditions (Class 0).
•	Privacy Preservation: Ensure the privacy of patients by utilizing anonymized health characteristics in the model. The use of key characteristics will enable the encoding of relevant patient details while protecting sensitive information, thus complying with data privacy regulations.

Methodology:
The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation stages:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Load the training dataset and the supplementary metadata dataset (greeks.csv) into Pandas Data Frames.
o	Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data points as appropriate.
o	Address outliers: Apply outlier detection and treatment techniques to enhance the quality of the data.
o	Explore and analyze the distributions of features to gain insights into the data.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Perform visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between the health characteristics and the target variable (Class).
o	Investigate the supplemental metadata (greeks.csv) to identify any patterns or correlations with the target variable.
3.	Feature Selection:
o	If necessary, use feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant health characteristics that contribute significantly to the prediction of age-related conditions.
4.	Model Building and Training:
o	Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
o	Implement multiple machine learning models based on the project's objectives, including:
	Logistic Regression
	XGBoost
	Random Forest
	Ensembled Learning
5.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6.	Conclusion and Documentation:
o	Summarize the results and conclusions drawn from the model evaluation.


                                        Data Preprocessing

Data Description:
The dataset provided for this project comprises two main components: the training dataset and the greeks dataset.
Training Dataset
The training dataset consists of 617 observations, each containing a unique ID and fifty-six health characteristics that have been anonymized. These characteristics include fifty-five numerical features and one categorical feature. Alongside the health characteristics, the dataset also includes a binary target variable called "Class." The primary goal of this project is to predict the Class of each observation based on its respective features.
Greeks Dataset
In addition to the training dataset, there is a supplementary metadata dataset called "greeks." This dataset provides additional information about each observation in the training dataset and encompasses five distinct features.
By utilizing these datasets, we aim to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify age-related conditions.
For a more comprehensive understanding of the datasets and to explore the detailed analysis, kindly refer to the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

Dataset

Data Shape

The dataset used in this analysis contains a total of 617 observations (rows) and 58 features (columns). Each row represents a unique individual with health-related characteristics, and each column corresponds to a specific attribute.

Statistical Information

A table was made that presents the summary statistics for the numeric features of the dataset. Each row corresponds to a specific numeric feature, and the statistics include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile (Q1), median (50th percentile or Q2), 75th percentile (Q3), and maximum values.
Highlight some key insights from the summary statistics:
AB: The feature "AB" has a mean value of approximately 0.48, indicating that, on average, it falls around 0.48 units. The minimum value is 0.081, and the maximum value is 6.162. This feature appears to have some variation.
AF: The "AF" feature represents health-related characteristics with a mean value of approximately 3502.01 and a standard deviation of 2300.32. The values range from 192.59 to 28688.19.
AH: The "AH" feature has a relatively low standard deviation compared to the mean, suggesting that the values tend to cluster around the mean of 118.62. The minimum value is 85.20, and the maximum value is 1910.12.
Class: The target variable "Class" is binary with values of 0 or 1. The mean of approximately 0.18 indicates that about 18% of the individuals have been diagnosed with age-related conditions (Class 1).
EJ_B: The binary categorical feature "EJ_B" has a mean value of approximately 0.64, suggesting that about 64% of the observations fall into this category.
Overall, the summary statistics provide valuable insights into the distribution and spread of the numeric features in the dataset. The mean, standard deviation, and quartile values offer an initial understanding of the data's central tendency and variability, which will be further explored during the data exploration phase.
                                                           Datatypes and Nulls

Dtypes: The data types of the columns are primarily of three types:
float64: There are 55 columns with float64 data type. These columns contain numeric values, which are often continuous or discrete measurements of various health-related characteristics.
int64: There is one column with int64 data type. This column is the target variable "Class," which is binary (0 or 1) and represents whether the individual has been diagnosed with age-related conditions (Class 1) or not (Class 0).
object: There are two columns with object data type. The column "Id" serves as a unique identifier for each observation, and the column "EJ" is a categorical feature representing a specific health characteristic.
Non-Null Count: The non-null count for each column represents the number of non-missing (non-null) values in that column. Missing values are indicated by null values.
Memory Usage: The memory usage for the dataset is approximately 279.7 KB. This provides an idea of the amount of memory used to store the dataset in its current format.
Missing Values:
Columns BQ, CB, CC, DU, EL, FC, FL, FS and GL have missing values (NaN) as indicated by non-null counts being less than 617 (the total number of entries). These missing values will need to be handled during the data preprocessing phase before building machine learning models.
The dataset's information and data types provide crucial insights into the nature of the features, their data representations, and any missing data, which will be valuable during subsequent data preprocessing and modeling steps.
                                                       Checking for Duplicated Values

To ensure data integrity and avoid potential biases in the analysis, it is essential to check for duplicated records in the dataset. Duplicated records occur when two or more rows have the exact same values for all columns, indicating possible data entry errors or data collection issues.
Upon performing the check for duplicated values, we find that there are no duplicated rows in the dataset. The total number of duplicated rows is 0.

                                 Hot Deck Imputation for Numerical Variables with Missing Values

Hot deck imputation is a method used to fill in missing values in a dataset by borrowing values from "donor" observations that are like the observations with missing data. In this implementation, we identify the numerical variables that have missing values and perform hot deck imputation for each of them. The identified numerical variables with missing values are: 'EL', 'BQ', 'CB', 'CC', 'DU', 'EL', 'FC', 'FL', 'FS', and 'GL'.
Implementation Steps:
•	For each variable with missing values, a "donor pool" is created using the rows that have non-null values for that variable.
•	We identify numeric columns that can be used for similarity calculation between observations (numeric_columns).
•	For each observation with a missing value in the variable, we calculate a similarity measure (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the observation and the donors in the donor pool using the numeric_columns.
•	The observation receives the value from the donor with the closest match based on the calculated similarity measure.
•	The missing values are imputed using the above process.
By imputing missing values, we ensured that the dataset is complete and ready for exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling.

                                                 Analyzing Target Variable
The bar plot displays the distribution of the target variable "Class," which indicates whether an individual has been diagnosed with age-related conditions or not. Class 0 represents individuals without age-related conditions, while Class 1 represents individuals diagnosed with age-related conditions.
From the plot, we observe the following:
Class 0: The bar for Class 0 has a count of 509, which represents approximately 82.5% of the total dataset. This indicates that a majority (82.5%) of the individuals in the dataset do not have age-related conditions.
Class 1: The bar for Class 1 has a count of 108, which represents approximately 17.5% of the total dataset. This indicates that a minority (17.5%) of the individuals in the dataset have been diagnosed with age-related conditions.
The class distribution is not perfectly balanced, with Class 0 being the dominant class and Class 1 being the minority class. Imbalanced class distribution can have implications on model performance, especially in binary classification tasks. We decided to balance the target variable using sampling techniques.
