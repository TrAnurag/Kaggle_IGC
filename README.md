    ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions (Kaggle Competition)

Project Summary:
Background
There is a significant effect of age on health. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small. 
Problem Statement
To develop a predictive model capable of detecting the presence of three specific medical conditions based on measurements of health characteristics. The model will aid researchers in identifying potential patients who may have one or more of the specified medical conditions without requiring a long and intrusive process of data collection from patients. Currently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions, yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases.

Object:
•	Predictive Model Development: Build and train a predictive model capable of accurately classifying individuals into two classes: those with age-related medical conditions (Class 1) and those without any age-related conditions (Class 0).
•	Privacy Preservation: Ensure the privacy of patients by utilizing anonymized health characteristics in the model. The use of key characteristics will enable the encoding of relevant patient details while protecting sensitive information, thus complying with data privacy regulations.

Methodology:
The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation stages:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Load the training dataset and the supplementary metadata dataset (greeks.csv) into Pandas Data Frames.
o	Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data points as appropriate.
o	Address outliers: Apply outlier detection and treatment techniques to enhance the quality of the data.
o	Explore and analyze the distributions of features to gain insights into the data.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Perform visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between the health characteristics and the target variable (Class).
o	Investigate the supplemental metadata (greeks.csv) to identify any patterns or correlations with the target variable.
3.	Feature Selection:
o	If necessary, use feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant health characteristics that contribute significantly to the prediction of age-related conditions.
4.	Model Building and Training:
o	Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
o	Implement multiple machine learning models based on the project's objectives, including:
	Logistic Regression
	XGBoost
	Random Forest
	Ensembled Learning
5.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6.	Conclusion and Documentation:
o	Summarize the results and conclusions drawn from the model evaluation.

Data Description:
The dataset provided for this project comprises two main components: the training dataset and the greeks dataset.
Training Dataset
The training dataset consists of 617 observations, each containing a unique ID and fifty-six health characteristics that have been anonymized. These characteristics include fifty-five numerical features and one categorical feature. Alongside the health characteristics, the dataset also includes a binary target variable called "Class." The primary goal of this project is to predict the Class of each observation based on its respective features.
Greeks Dataset
In addition to the training dataset, there is a supplementary metadata dataset called "greeks." This dataset provides additional information about each observation in the training dataset and encompasses five distinct features.
By utilizing these datasets, we aim to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify age-related conditions.
For a more comprehensive understanding of the datasets and to explore the detailed analysis, kindly refer to the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

Libraries Used
- Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like dataframe and Series, which allow you to work with structured data easily. You can load, filter, transform, and analyze data using pandas.
- Numpy: numpy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
- 
•	Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python. It allows you to create various types of plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more, to visualize your data and results.
•	%matplotlib inline: This is a Jupyter Notebook magic command. It allows the matplotlib plots to be displayed directly within the notebook cells.

•	Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations and can enhance the default matplotlib plots.

•	Sklearn(Scikit-learn): Scikit-learn is a powerful machine learning library in Python. It provides a wide range of tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. It includes many classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms.

•	Train_test_split: This function from `sklearn.model_selection` helps in splitting the data into training and testing sets for building and evaluating machine learning models.
•	R2_score`, `mean_squared_error`: These are evaluation metrics from `sklearn.metrics` for regression tasks. R-squared (R2) measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Mean squared error (MSE) calculates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
•	Classification_report: This function from `sklearn.metrics` generates a text report showing the main classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, and support) for each class in a classification problem.
•	Confusion_matrix: Also from `sklearn.metrics`, this function computes the confusion matrix to evaluate classification model performance.
•	Precision_score, recall_score, f1_score: These functions from `sklearn.metrics` are used to compute precision, recall, and F1-score for binary or multiclass classification problems.
•	Roc_curve, auc: These functions from `sklearn.metrics` are used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate binary classification model performance. AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a metric that represents the area under the ROC curve.
•	Precision_recall_curve, average_precision_score: These functions from `sklearn.metrics` are used for precision-recall curve analysis, which is especially useful for imbalanced classification problems.
•	Make_scorer: This function from `sklearn. metrics` allows creating custom scoring functions for use in model evaluation during cross-validation.
